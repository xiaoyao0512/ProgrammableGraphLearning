Heltech - This backend mimics the behavior of the Valgrind backend, Helgrind.
These analysis tools attempt to identify data races.  Heltech uses a Contech
task graph to identify the last write to any virtual address and checks
whether subsequent accesses have an ordering using the task dependencies.
