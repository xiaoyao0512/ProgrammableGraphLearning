This directory is provides for the ongoing development of the Contech
instrumentation pass as operates with LLVM 3.8+.

As LLVM continues to evolve its APIs, the Contech pass has become increasingly
brittle as it tries to target 3.2 through 3.7.  With 3.9, cmake will also
be required and therefore this pass version will also have this requirement.
